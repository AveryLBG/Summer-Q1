    <body>
      <p>My Name is Avery Garner, I am 14 years old going into my 
        freshman year of Hercules High School. I enjoy drawing, playing video games, and I want to learn how to code.
         I am a social person and enjoy talking to people often, and mesh with most people pretty well.</p>
      <p>So far, at the Hidden Genius Project, I have learned what RSE was, computational thinking, and why these are important.</p>
